# 👋 Hi, I'm Ashok Maharjan

I am a data scientist from a [TripleTen data science bootcamp](https://tripleten.com/) with a strong foundation in biology. How did this transition from biology to data science happen? The inception for data analysis was sown when I was doing my master's in biological science at Bowling Green State University. I was aware at that time that creating amazing graphs and unraveling the story hidden in data was always a challenging task. I always wondered what it would be like if I knew more about data science.

While working as a lab assistant at the University of Toledo, I was amazed by the volcano plot and heat map of gene expression data created by one of the postdocs working in our lab. Later, working as a research senior technician, I taught myself single-cell RNA analysis and microbiome analysis. Particularly, I was awestruck by how UMAP created clusters of different cells. As I explored more, I realized that an unsupervised machine learning algorithm was behind that wonderful figure.

I was at the crossroads of my career: continue working in the lab or pursue a career that had always fascinated me? I am a person who is curious and passionate about something, and I will achieve that goal no matter what. I decided to follow my passion. I decided to deep dive into data science. It was a turning point in my life.

To pursue my passion, I began self-study to master Python programming and pandas for data wrangling. To cement my knowledge into structured and goal-oriented study, I enrolled in the [TripleTen data science bootcamp](https://tripleten.com/). I completed 15+ hands-on projects across:

🧠 Machine Learning & Deep Learning  
📊 Data Analysis & Visualization  
🦮 NLP & Computer Vision  
⏳ Time Series Forecasting  
📃 SQL & Statistical Inference

These projects not only taught me the fundamentals of data science but also how to approach, tackle, and solve problems as a data scientist. Nowadays, I am learning more about deep learning to increase the repertoire of my data science knowledge. I am also exploring projects catered to biological, healthcare, and genomics data.

Outside work, I enjoy walking and cycling in trails, finding inspiration for problem-solving in nature.
