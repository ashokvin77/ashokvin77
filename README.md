# 👋 Hi, I'm Ashok Maharjan

I am a data scientist with a strong foundation in biology.

My journey into data science began during my master's in biological science at Bowling Green State University, where I discovered that creating compelling visualizations and unraveling stories hidden in data was both challenging and fascinating. I found myself constantly wondering about the deeper mechanisms behind data analysis.

While working as a lab assistant at the University of Toledo, I was captivated by the volcano plots and heatmaps of gene expression data created by one of the postdocs in our lab. This fascination grew as I advanced to research senior technician, where I taught myself single-cell RNA analysis and microbiome analysis. I was particularly awestruck by how UMAP created beautiful clusters of different cells. When I discovered that unsupervised machine learning algorithms were behind these wonderful visualizations, I knew I had found my path.

This realization sparked a pivotal moment in my career. The power of data to reveal hidden patterns and drive meaningful insights became undeniable to me. I made the decision to transition fully into data science, driven by the power of data to create meaningful impact across diverse fields.

I began with intensive self-study in Python programming and pandas for data wrangling. To formalize my expertise, I enrolled in the TripleTen data science bootcamp, where I completed 15+ hands-on projects across:

🧠 Machine Learning & Deep Learning  
📊 Data Analysis & Visualization  
🦮 NLP & Computer Vision  
⏳ Time Series Forecasting  
📃 SQL & Statistical Inference

These projects not only taught me the fundamentals of data science but also how to approach, tackle, and solve problems as a data scientist. Nowadays, I am learning more about deep learning to increase the repertoire of my data science knowledge. I am also exploring projects catered to biological, healthcare, and genomics data.

Outside work, I enjoy walking and cycling in trails, finding inspiration for problem-solving in nature.
